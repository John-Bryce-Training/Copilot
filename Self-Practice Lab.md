# Copilot Studio â€“ Self-Practice Lab

## Lab Goals

- Create and configure a new Agent.
- Add at least 5 useful tools that can process text or images.
- Create and integrate at least one Flow that performs an automatic action.
- Test your Agent in a real conversation.

---

## Instructions

### 1. Create a New Agent

- Set up a new Copilot Agent.
- Give your Agent a relevant name and description.

### 2. Add Tools

- Explore the available **Tools** in Copilot Studio (under the Tools/Plugins/Extensions section).
- Add at least **5 different tools** to your Agent:
  - Tools should include at least some that process text (e.g., language detection, text summarization, sentiment analysis, etc.).
  - If available, add at least one tool that can process images (e.g., image description, OCR, etc.).
- Understand what each tool does and consider in which part of the conversation it would be useful.

### 3. Create and Integrate a Flow

- Design a simple **Agent Flow** that performs an automatic action  
  (for example: returns the current date/time, echoes user input, generates a greeting, etc.).
- Add the Flow as a Tool and integrate it into a relevant Topic or conversation path.

### 4. Test Your Agent

- Use the Test/Preview chat feature in Copilot Studio to interact with your Agent.
- Make sure you trigger all the tools and your custom Flow at least once.
- Try different types of text and/or image inputs and observe the responses.

## What to Submit?

- A brief summary describing:
  - The Agent you created.
  - The 5 tools you added and what they do.
  - The Flow you built and how you integrated it.
  - Screenshots of at least one conversation demonstrating the use of your tools and Flow.

> **Notes**
>
> - Feel free to experiment and try out additional tools or configurations, even beyond the minimum requirements.
> - If you encounter limitations (e.g., no access to image tools in your free trial), describe how you adapted or which alternative tools you used.

Good luck!
